    "about": [
      "This introspective short story explores the disconnect between outward perception and inner experience. The narrator, often labeled as \"quiet,\" reveals how they actively listen and observe, yet struggle to be heard in return. Surrounded by people they’ve known for years, they still feel invisible, their words met with indifference, their presence fading into the background. The piece wrestles with self-doubt (\"Maybe I’m boring\"), the habit of self-blame, and the quiet resignation to being misunderstood. Ultimately, it’s a poignant commentary on how silence can be louder than noise, and how being labeled \"quiet\" often says more about others’ inability to listen."

    "about": [
      "A deceptively simple tale about cursed luck—where every line piles on another absurd misfortune. The narrator’s deadpan delivery turns a mundane moment (picking up a \"lucky\" penny) into a rapid-fire spiral of chaos. The punchline? Even rejecting the \"charm\" backfires. Perfect for fans of ironic humor and micro-fiction with bite."
